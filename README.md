Crosh Window
============

This Chrome-OS-only app changes Crosh to open in a separate window,
rather than a browser tab, so that Ctrl-N/T/etc. can pass through to
it. Note that for this to work you must, after installing it,
right-click the Crosh Window app and select the "Open as window"
setting or Ctrl-N/etc. will not be passed through. (If you've
forgotten to do this you'll see that the window has a URL bar between
the title bar and the terminal pane.)
